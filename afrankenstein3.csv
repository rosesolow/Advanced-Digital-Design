dialogue,
How can I move thee, 
Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, 
who implores thy goodness and compassion, 
Believe me, 
Frankenstein, 
I was benevolent, 
my soul glowed with love and humanity, 
but am I not alone, 
miserably alone, 
You, 
my creator, 
abhor me, 
what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, 
who owe me nothing, 
They spurn and hate me, 
The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge, 
I have wandered here many days, 
the caves of ice, 
which I only do not fear, 
are a dwelling to me, 
and the only one which man does not grudge, 
These bleak skies I hail, 
for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings, 
If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, 
they would do as you do, 
and arm themselves for my destruction, 
Shall I not then hate them who abhor me, 
I will keep no terms with my enemies, 
I am miserable, 
and they shall share my wretchedness, 
Yet it is in your power to recompense me, 
and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, 
that not only you and your family, 
but thousands of others, 
shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage, 
Let your compassion be moved, 
and do not disdain me, 
Listen to my tale, 
when you have heard that, 
abandon or commiserate me, 
as you shall judge that I deserve, 
But hear me, 
The guilty are allowed, 
by human laws, 
bloody as they are, 
to speak in their own defence before they are condemned, 
Listen to me, 
Frankenstein, 
You accuse me of murder, 
and yet you would, 
with a satisfied conscience, 
destroy your own creature, 
Oh, 
praise the eternal justice of man, 
Yet I ask you not to spare me, 
listen to me, 
and then, 
if you can, 
and if you will, 
destroy the work of your hands
